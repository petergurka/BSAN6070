# BSAN6070

The files necessary for this project should be found in the MSBA Colab Folder under ML Algorithms under CA03 in the same fashion as the other assignments have done

All answers to the other portions of the assignment (written) can be found in the Word Document attached. 

Other than the data and the word document, no other files should be needed for this assignment. Please note that some packages are different if ran in Jupyter, 
which is described within the Python notebook.
